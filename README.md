# Node-GraphQL

A Node.js project integrating GraphQL for building flexible APIs.

## Description

Node-GraphQL is a project that combines the power of Node.js with GraphQL to create flexible and efficient APIs. This project serves as a starting point for developers looking to build GraphQL APIs using Node.js.

## Features

- Integration of Node.js and GraphQL
- Customizable server setup
- Auto-reloading during development with nodemon
- Placeholder for running tests

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grxkun/node-graphql.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the Node.js server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server using the default entry point (`index.js`).

### Development Mode

During development, you can use nodemon for auto-reloading. Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server with auto-reloading enabled, making it easy to develop and test your code.

### Testing

To run tests (placeholder), use:

```bash
npm test
```

Replace the placeholder with the actual command to run your tests.
